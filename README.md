I'm re-learning some basic html, i'll be trying to do a simples recipe list, let's see how far i'll go for now.

Finished the assignment, some things i tried to improve:

1. Always remember to alt the imgs.
2. Check the code to find any errors before posting.
3. Trying to remember how to put the code on github.

Some other toughts:

1.Tried to do some CSS but got lazy and just centered the index page.
2.Took a lot more time to finish than i tought, but it was pretty fun.
